# GifButtons

### Description

This is a simple GIF searching app that uses the GIPHY API.

### How to Use

You can interact with the app as follows:

1. Click a button displayed to view ten related GIFs with their ratings.

2. If the type of dance you want to search is not on existing buttons, create your own button using the input field at the top.

3. To animate the GIF, click the still image.

4. To pause the GIF, click it again.

5. To visit the original GIF page, click on the rating ribbon.
